In my current role I develop and maintain an ‘in-house’ engineering software application used for the performance simulation of thermodynamic systems, primarily aircraft environmental control systems and gas turbines. I provide training, mentoring and day-to-day troubleshooting to the engineering user community as well as fellow application developers.
